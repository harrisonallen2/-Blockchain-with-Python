**Instruction: step by step**

**New startup market race - initial requirement**

Main focus of a newly founded company is to build a portfolio management system (PMS) that supports both, traditional assets (like gold, silver, stocks, etc) and currently very hot topic - crypto-assets!!! But, as there are so many coins out there, our task to understand how HD wallets work, and to build out a system that can create them.

**Race to the market: Let the games begin !!!**

Unfortunately, there aren't as many tools available in Python for this sort of thing, yet.

Thankfully, there is a command line tool, hd-wallet-derive that supports not only BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44, but also supports non-standard derivation paths for the most popular wallets out there today!

Indeed, we have to develop and integrate the script wallet.py at backend with our dearest old friend, Python.

Once we integrate this "universal" wallet, we can use it to manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins, and it will give us serious edge against the competition.

In this assignment, we will only need to get 2 coins working: Ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet. Ethereum keys are the same format on any network, so the Ethereum keys should work with your custom networks or testnets.

Dependencies

- PHP must be installed on your operating system (any version, 5 or 7). Don't worry, you will not need to know any PHP (just in case if ./derive is not working in comand line, which in my experience happened on Windows machine, we will use it as a backup in one coding line).
- We have to clone the hd-wallet-derive tool.
- bit Python Bitcoin library.
- web3.py Python Ethereum library.

Set-up Project

- Create a project directory called wallet and cd into it.
- Clone the hd-wallet-derive tool into this folder and install it using the instructions on its README.md.
- Create a symlink called derive for the hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php script into the top level project directory like so: ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive
  This will clean up the command needed to run the script in our code, as we can call ./derive instead of ./hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php.
- Test that you can run the ./derive script properly, use one of the examples on the repo's README.md.

NOTE: If one get an error running ./derive, as it can happen on windows machine then use: php ./hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php.

- Create a file called wallet.py -- this will be your universal wallet script.

Your directory tree should look something like this:

**Setup constants file to manage coins**

- In a separate file, constants.py, set the following constants:
  - BTC = 'btc'
  - ETH = 'eth'
  - BTCTEST = 'btc-test'
- In wallet.py, import all constants: from constants import \*
- Use these anytime you reference these strings, both in function calls, and in setting object keys.

Generate a Mnemonic phrase

- Generate a new 12 word mnemonic using hd-wallet-derive or by using this tool.
- Set this mnemonic as an environment variable, and include the one you generated as a fallback using: mnemonic = os.getenv('MNEMONIC', 'insert mnemonic here')

Deriving a wallet

- Pass as variables Mnemonic (--mnemonic), Coin (--coin) and Numderive (--numderive), then set the --format=json flag, parse the output into a JSON object using json.loads(output).And finally pass all into one function, called 'derive\_wallets'.
- When done properly, the final object should look something like this (there are only 3 children each in this image):
- Accounts used in the project are marked for BTC Test and ETH

**Executing test transactions by calling the functions from wallet.py**

BTCTest transaction

```btc\_acc = priv\_key\_to\_account(BTCTEST,btc\_PrivateKey) ``` ```create\_trx(BTCTEST,btc\_acc,"miZgMxdGzSxCTpWazfD2KqhewoUvcQ6CC1", 0.1)``` ```send\_trx(BTCTEST,btc\_acc,'miZgMxdGzSxCTpWazfD2KqhewoUvcQ6CC1',0.1)```

**Confirmation of Executed Transaction**

**ETH transaction - using local private blockchain**

```eth\_acc = priv\_key\_to\_account(ETH,eth\_PrivateKey) ```

```create\_trx(ETH,eth\_acc,"0xba51af165c60A32B3d23Df9B332b4A86cED4A1B9", 1000)``` 

```send\_trx(ETH, eth\_acc,"0xba51af165c60A32B3d23Df9B332b4A86cED4A1B9", 1000)```

**Confirmation of Executed Transaction**
